#Execution
You can use the Cliff Walking environment as a sample scenario, but your code must work on other Gymnasium environments with other discrete state and action spaces.

#Submission
In the Cliff Walking environment, run your Double Q-learning agent. Prepare a PDF file that includes (1) a plot of a learning curve that shows the average reward every 10 episodes and (2) the optimal episode (s,a,r,s', ...) generated by the trained model.
Source code (mypa3_mf_control.py). Do not change the class/function/class member variable names, as usual. Your code will be evaluated by automated tests.
